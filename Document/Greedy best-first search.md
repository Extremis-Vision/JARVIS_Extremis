### Summary :
search algorithm that expands the node that is closest to the goal, as estimated by a heuristic (estimate the distance) function h(n)

The Greedy Best-First Search explores the graph by prioritizing the expansion of the node nearest to the goal, estimated by the heuristic function \( h(n) \). While it may find a solution quickly, it does not guarantee optimality as it can get trapped in areas with false heuristic estimations.
