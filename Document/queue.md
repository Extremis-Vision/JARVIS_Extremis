### Summary :
First-in First-out

### Definition: 
First-in First-out (FIFO) is a linear data structure that follows the principle "the first element added to the data structure is the first one to be removed". This is useful for maintaining a list of items in the order they were inserted, or for implementing algorithms like breadth-first search.
